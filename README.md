## Overview 

Project Checkpoint Mark II (working title) is the codename for the successor to the
official website of Filipino video game content creation group Saveroom1st Productions AKA SR1P. A video game content creation clique aiming to create a group/community where gamers, creators and culture-keepers come together to “save” new memories within games, hobbies and media.

The "Mark II" in the project codename signifies a restart - not as a patch, redesign or
rebrand necessarily but as a complete reimagining of SR1P's online identity. This version 
is built to reflect who we are now: creators with purpose, a grassroots community staying
true to its roots and content with unfiltered quality.

This journey from courses and tutorials to production-ready is real and challenging but 
this is not just a website. It's our code, our culture and our checkpoint. 

## Tech Stack 
- **Laravel Framework:** v12.34.0 (Released Oct 2025)
- **PHP:** 8.2+
- **Database:** MySQL (Agila Hosting)
- **Frontend Stack:** Blade + Tailwind + optional retro-styled UI
- **Deployment:** Agila Hosting via FTP

Note: Project Checkpoint Mark II was initially planned with MongoDB for flexibility in content structure. However, due to Agila Hosting’s current lack of MongoDB support, the stack has pivoted to MySQL, ensuring full Laravel compatibility and seamless deployment.
