## Overview 

Project Checkpoint Mark II (working title) is the codename for the successor to the
official website of Filipino video game content creation group Saveroom1st Productions AKA SR1P. A video game content creation clique aiming to create a group/community where gamers, creators and culture-keepers come together to “save” new memories within games, hobbies and media.

The "Mark II" in the project codename signifies a restart - not as a patch, redesign or
rebrand necessarily but as a complete reimagining of SR1P's online identity. This version 
is built to reflect who we are now: creators with purpose, a grassroots community staying
true to its roots and content with unfiltered quality. 

This journey from courses and tutorials to production-ready is real and challenging but 
this is not just a website. It's our code, our culture and our checkpoint.
